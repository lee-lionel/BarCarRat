Barcarrat Rules : 
1. Place wager (your bet) – Choose between 5, 10, 15, 20
2. Cards 2 through 9 are worth their face value in points
3. Aces are worth 1 point whilst 10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 0 points.
4. The total points of a hand are calculated by adding the values of the individual cards, but only the last digit of the total is used. (i.e. if a hand has a 7 and an 8, totalling 15, the hand is worth 5 points)
5. You and the computer will be dealt 2 cards.
6. Each party (player or computer) has the choice to draw only 1 additional card, if they are not satisfied with their hand value. (Click Hit)
7. If you are satisfied with your hand value, you can choose to not draw (Click Stand)
8. Compare the hand value of both players, and the winner is determined by having the higher hand value
9. If you or the computer has a hand value of 8 or 9 in your starting hand (of 2 cards), it is called a Natural eight/nine, where you skip the drawing of additional card and compare both parties hands to determine the winner.
10. Wager calculation is based on the winner’s hand: 
if you have 3 cards in hand, all 3 cards have the same value (i.e. 3) OR all 3 cards have the same suit (i.e. ♠️) the winner wins 3x of the initial wager (if player lose, player loses 3x of his bet) 
if you have 2 cards in hand, and both cards have the same value (i.e. 4) OR both cards have the same suit (i.e. ♠️) the winner wins 2x of the initial wager (if player lose, player loses 3x of his bet) 
Otherwise, the winner only wins 1x of the initial wager
